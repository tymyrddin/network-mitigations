# Nethogs 

[NetHogs](https://github.com/raboof/nethogs) is a small 'net top' tool which instead of breaking the traffic down per protocol or per subnet, groups bandwidth by process. If there is suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can see which PID is causing this. This makes it easy to identify programs that have gone wild and are suddenly taking up your bandwidth.
