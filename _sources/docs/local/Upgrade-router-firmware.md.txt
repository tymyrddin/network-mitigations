# Upgrade router firmware

Check the router provider's or manufacturer's website regularly to check you are running the latest firmware version. Firmware updates often enhance product performance, fix flaws, and address security vulnerabilities. Some routers allow checking for firmware updates directly from the interface and some routers have the option to turn on automatic updates.

And check first. Some updates may involve new services like [WPS](Disable-WPS.md) (which sometimes are best disabled).
