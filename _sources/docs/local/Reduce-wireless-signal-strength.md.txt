# Reduce wireless signal strength

A Wi-Fi signal frequently propagates well beyond the perimeters of a home. This allows for eavesdropping by intruders outside the home perimeter. Carefully consider antenna placement, antenna type, and transmission power levels. By experimenting with router placement and signal strength levels, the transmitting coverage of a Wi-Fi network can be decreased, thereby reducing risk of compromise. 

Limitations: a motivated attacker may still be able to intercept a signal that has limited coverage.
