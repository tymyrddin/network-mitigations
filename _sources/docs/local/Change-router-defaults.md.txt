# Change router defaults

Many routers, including wireless access points, are pre-configured with a default administrator passwords to simplify setup and attackers constantly try to break into devices using these publicly known credentials. They may be readily available on the internet, or may even be physically labelled on the router itself. 

Sometimes referred to as the “network name,” a service set identifier (SSID) is a unique name that identifies a particular wireless local area network (WLAN, Wireless home network). All wireless devices on a WLAN must use the same SSID to communicate with each other. Because the device's default SSID typically identifies the manufacturer or the actual device, an attacker can use this to identify the device and exploit any of its known vulnerabilities. [Make your SSID unique] and do not tie it to your identity or location—information that makes it easier for the attacker to identify your home network.
