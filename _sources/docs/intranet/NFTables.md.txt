# NFTables

For ''NAT'':

* The ARP address family only supports the input and output hook
* The bridge address family only supports the input, forward and output hook?
* Masquerading is a kind of source NAT.
* nftables masquerade will not work if iptables masquerade is in the kernel (unload or disable it).

    # Source NAT. Masquerading is a kind of source NAT.
    # Can only be used in chains of type nat and only works in the output path.
    # Make sure masquerading is enabled in the kernel (true if using default kernel)
